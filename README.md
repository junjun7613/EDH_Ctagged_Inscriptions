# EDH_Ctagged_Inscriptions

## What is this dataset?
This dataset includes the XML files for mainly Latin inscriptions. All inscription data is based on [the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg](https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/), one of the most well-known databases in the Roman studies, by downloading all the XML files it provided in Creative Commons Licence BY-SA. 
However, we made slight additional editings to that in order to enable more sophisticated and granular use of the textual data. The modifications are as follows:

- put \<c\> to each single characters in the text
- use \<sourceDoc\> as a text container instead of original \<body\>
